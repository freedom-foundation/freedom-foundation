üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @freedom-foundation. What you are looking at is my GitHub profile. The profile is designed to be a homepage for myself to look over my work and continue work. As I work on code this profile will be updated to showcase my current work. It is an index of all of my repos. All of my repositories have mention and links. Only my repositories or contributions are linked here.
 Clicking the repo links will show a readme  expounding upon the description mentioned. The copyright and liscense should be displayed at the top. Much of this is PUBLIC DOMAIN. Some are not free to copy, notably My Declaration I released under a view & read only license.
 The founding documents of Freedom Foundation follow:
- [The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/The-unanimous-Declaration-of-the-thirteen-united-States-of-America),
- [My Declaration](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/My_Declaration),‚ö° Not so fun fact: I wrote My Declaration under the stress of 21 well documented crimes against me.
- [Articles of Confederation and perpetual Union](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/Articles-of-Confederation-and-perpetual-Union),
- [Constitution for the United States of America amended fiVth Article](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/Constitution-for-the-United-States-of-America-amended-fiVth-Article/tree/main),
‚ö° Fun fact: The bill of rights is actually one single amendment.
- and [Journal of The Congress](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/Journal-of-The-Congress/tree/main).‚ö° Not so fun fact: I journaled The Congress in a radioactive wasteland. [[W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldwater_Creek_(Missouri_river_tributary)#Mallinckrodt_nuclear_waste_contamination)]

 These documents have priority to be archived in both [ASCII](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/ASCII-format-for-Network-Interchange) wordcounted and checksummed text and PDF/A-1 archive format for long term preservation then signed and attested, garunteed to be veritable to corresponding printed replica documents.

 These have priority yet there is more:
 [CSLC](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/Copper_Sovereign_Liberty_Coin),
 [freePress‚Ñ¢](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/freePress), [The Holy Bible](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/kjbible) and [Republican_form_TorTV](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/Republican_form_TorTV) Part of freePress‚Ñ¢ is a candidCamera which requires something auch as [proofmode-android](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/proofmode-android) or [HMAC-MD5](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/Message-Digest_Algorithms/blob/main/rfc6151.txt) - I suggest a small cryptography chip incorporated in the camera hardware and [opencamera-code](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/opencamera-code) is a viable option to get untainted hardware output, yet this also depends on [The_design_of_a_high_speed_CMOS_image_sensor](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/The_design_of_a_high_speed_CMOS_image_sensor) and a secure hardware design, Closed-Circuit and shielded. Otherwise you could be recording cartoons injected as binary streams into the camera and none of that should hold up in court or be considered reliable intelligence or news. ‚ö° Fun fact: The primary payload of the Blackbird was realFilm.

 Now I focus on finding the right [unicode map](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/unicode_map) because in order to make checksums veritable the exact encoding must also be included: years go by and the checksums are not sure without the map. I will use [veraPDF apps](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/veraPDF-apps) to validate the PDF releases for archiving. My focus shifts to [vernam-expert-telegram
](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/vernam-expert-telegram) a service which depends on veritable ASCII.

Take a look at my [gists](https://gist.github.com/freedom-foundation). 
 üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in sourcecode and libre-sourcecode.
  Libre-sourcecode being defined as allof a machine specification (chip design), compiler and application sourcecode which can be written out in respective computer programming languages and archived, saved, transmit, reproduced, and build and run all from paper written legit.
   I looked into [libretro](https://github.com/libretro) to clarify if "[cores](https://github.com/libretro/docs/issues/998?notification_referrer_id=NT_kwDOCrGlnbUxMzA5ODIxMDk5ODoxNzk0MTQ0Mjk#issuecomment-2448401228)" correspond to chip designes or if they are only verbatim. I had some interest in OpenSPARC and FPGA and just seeing if an emulator can achieve the same. You may wonder what is so ultimate about  [The_Ultimate_Game_Boy](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/The_Ultimate_Game_Boy).

üå±  I‚Äôm currently learning how to use [git](https://github.com/git/git) and GitHub in order to download and then search and view code to look for bugs and do mantainence or find code to import into my own code.
      My experience so far with git has been tiresome. Having to re-add a file after every edit before a commit is needless. I found [git-guides](https://github.com/git-guides) and after reading it explains some of the use of git, much of which I do not need right now. Most of my repositories are in ALPHA phase meaning there is no finished release yet, so I have no need for careful branches or meticulous history. There is also a [bug](https://lore.kernel.org/git/P_ttzPnNTtUgpAy8cg_ntLvwskJhz7cmv-fFgDw0K4Y2vOCx8v_AXxHtHEuBtpREOQu9pxpvK6JgLusc5Uyn2wDZ4HZvC3ttM4k-Ry6jBs8=@proton.me/) in where a git user may be cornered in to having to [delete files](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/1611_King_James_Bible/issues/2#issuecomment-2453442561). As for GitHub [vigilant_guardian_test](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/vigilant_guardian_test) failed because of Termux [junk](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/vigilant_guardian_test/issues/1). I still have not yet figured out my basic op-sec intention of de-authing every login to my account[ #144821](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/144821). I did notice "you are already logged in" when using gh-CLI and since I have no reply from GitHub about #144821 it is safe to operate under the assumption of a compromised account. That being said I will keep everything on my GitHub public. Because privacy options are, at best, meaningless when the login is compromised, yet, having privacy may be worse if locked in with an attacker.
 Further, here is another example I pulled from GitHub [community](https://github.com/community) to beware of with GitHub: Account banned(?) w/ no reason specified, support hasn't responded in 3 weeks, what do I do? [#132061](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/132061). Beware, and bear in mind that GitHub could block my account at any time. It is really important to keep a local copy of everything on my GitHub and write down my contact info.
 Now since I have been blocked from the community organization and cannot comment because of [discussioncomment-11359280](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/23204#discussioncomment-11359280), and many more community posts marked SPAM for unexplained reasons, it is safe to assume I could be locked out of my account at any time. It is safe to assume GitHub is not a reliable product. It is really important to keep a local copy of everything on my GitHub and see the section, üì´ How to reach me, below.
 
  Learning git has been slow if not halted. You would think that GitHub would provide a guide or that there would be an official manual for git, some way to [discover](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/144835#discussion-7495691) how to use git. I was blocked from GitHub community and marked for spam after asking only regular help questions. I reached out to the git [mailing list](https://lore.kernel.org/git/?q=a_bughunter). If you would like to help feel free to answer any open questions there.
  My programming construction design is not to rely on external libraries therefore all required code dependencies should be included therein each repo preferably in the code, or an acompanying clone of libs required. All required code should be found in my repos without reliance on any secondparty: No outsourced dependencies.

üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on general welfare and public interest projects these are open for participation and volunteer for the betters now. America need's farmers. An example of a public interest repo of mine is CopWatch. AmericA need's [CopWatch](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/Copwatch_Database).

Join now! I now build my community [Peeranoia_Framework](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/Peeranoia_Framework) and so far so good: take a look! If you can do a checksum you qualify to join PEERANOIA. Get into the [Discussion](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/Peeranoia_Framework/discussions/1). Join now! For PEERANOIA these repos which are PD or free to copy, such as The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, I welcome any to copy, clone, or fork. I actually encourage copying because you can participate in PEERANOIA by signing a checksum of these. You would clone a repo and then do a checksum and use a throwaway private-key and sign the checksums then store the checksum along with the public-key. The public key then stands alone to attest to the accuracy of the checksums for latter-day FIC of the content of my repos.

Private endeavours include [physics](https://gist.github.com/freedom-foundation/280feb4ef9c35645c774dc8952156a6e) and [quantum physics](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/Quantum_Reality) related components such as [Chronometer](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/Chronometer). Such may be public for a while then private.

üì´ How to reach me, my public GitHub git email address is 179414429+freedom-foundation@users.noreply.github.com this should relay to the following or any latter updated current email, my general-use email is A_bughunter(at)proton(dot)me this has Proton's server-side PGP enabled and auto GPG enabled. However Proton GPG may not be secure to my machine.
- For [Letters of marque and reprisal](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/unicode_map#letters-of-marque-and-reprisal) email Letters_of_Marque_and_Reprisal(at)protonmail(dot)com I used the .com domain here which is an old official standard of domain (.org, .net, .com)
