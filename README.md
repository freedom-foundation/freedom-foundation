üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @freedom-foundation. The founding documents of Freedom Foundation follow:
- [The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/The-unanimous-Declaration-of-the-thirteen-united-States-of-America),
- [My Declaration](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/My_Declaration),‚ö° Not so fun fact: I wrote My Declaration under the stress of over 21 well documented crimes against me.
- [Articles of Confederation and perpetual Union](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/Articles-of-Confederation-and-perpetual-Union),
- [Constitution for the United States of America amended fiVth Article](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/Constitution-for-the-United-States-of-America-amended-fiVth-Article/tree/main),
‚ö° Fun fact: The bill of rights is actually one single amendment.
- and [Journal of The Congress](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/Journal-of-The-Congress/tree/main).‚ö° Not so fun fact: I journaled The Congress in a radioactive wasteland. [[W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldwater_Creek_(Missouri_river_tributary)#Mallinckrodt_nuclear_waste_contamination)]

 These documents have priority to be archived in both [ASCII](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/ASCII-format-for-Network-Interchange) wordcounted and checksummed text and PDF/A-1 archive format for long term preservation then signed and attested, garunteed to be veritable to corresponding printed replica documents.
 These have priority yet there is more:
 [CSLC](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/Copper_Sovereign_Liberty_Coin),
 [freePress‚Ñ¢](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/freePress) and [1611KJV](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/kjbible)

 Now I focus on finding the right [unicode map](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/unicode_map) because in order to make checksums veritable the exact encoding must also be included: years go by and the checksums are not sure without the map. I will use [veraPDF apps](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/veraPDF-apps) to validate the PDF releases for archiving. 

Take a look at my [gists](https://gist.github.com/freedom-foundation). 
 üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in sourcecode and libre-sourcecode.
  Libre-sourcecode being defined as allof a machine specification (chip design), compiler and application sourcecode which can be written out in respective computer programming languages and archived, saved, transmit, reproduced, and build and run all from paper written legit.
   I looked into [libretro](https://github.com/libretro) to clarify if "[cores](https://github.com/libretro/docs/issues/998?notification_referrer_id=NT_kwDOCrGlnbUxMzA5ODIxMDk5ODoxNzk0MTQ0Mjk#issuecomment-2448401228)" correspond to chip designes or if they are only verbatim. I had some interest in OpenSPARC and FPGA and just seeing if an emulator can achieve the same.

üå±  I‚Äôm currently learning how to use [git](https://github.com/git/git) and GitHub in order to download and then search and view code to look for bugs and do mantainence or find code to import into my own code.
      My experience so far with git has been tiresome. Having to re-add a file after every edit before a commit is needless. I found [git-guides](https://github.com/git-guides) and after reading it explains some of the use of git, much of which I do not need right now. Most of my repositories are in ALPHA phase meaning there is no finished release yet, so I have no need for careful branches or meticulous history. There is also a bug [ #9901 ](https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/9901)in where a git user may be cornered in to having to [delete files](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/1611_King_James_Bible/issues/2#issuecomment-2453442561). As for GitHub I still have not yet figured out my basic intention of de-authing every login to my account[ #144821](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/144821).
  Learning git has been slow if not halted. You would think that GitHub would provide a guide or that there would be an official manual for git Some way to [discover](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/144835#discussion-7495691) how to use git.

üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on general welfare and public interest projects these are open for participation and volunteer for the betters now. America need's farmers. AmericA need's CopWatch. Now building my community [Peeranoia_Framework](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/Peeranoia_Framework) and so far so good: take a look! An example of a public interest repo of mine is CopWatch.   . Private endeavours include [physics](https://gist.github.com/freedom-foundation/280feb4ef9c35645c774dc8952156a6e) and [quantum physics](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/Quantum_Reality) related components such as [Chronometer](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/Chronometer). Such may be public for a while then private.

üì´ How to reach me, my public GitHub git email address is 179414429+freedom-foundation@users.noreply.github.com this should relay to the following or any latter updated current email, my general-use email is A_bughunter(at)proton(dot)me this has Proton's server-side PGP enabled and auto GPG enabled. However Proton GPG may not be secure to my machine.
- For [Letters of marque and reprisal](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/unicode_map#letters-of-marque-and-reprisal) email Letters_of_Marque_and_Reprisal(at)protonmail(dot)com I used the .com domain here which is an old official standard of domain (.org, .net, .com)
